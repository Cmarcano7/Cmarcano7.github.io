# Unit 02 CSS and Bootstrap Homework: Responsive Portfolio

This homework was based on making a application with a responsive design that would ensure that it would render well on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes.

## Directions

I will use the Bootstrap CSS Framework to create a mobile responsive portfolio. How did I deliver this? First here are some guidelines:

* Create the following files files: `index.html`, `portfolio.html` and `contact.html`.

* Using Bootstrap, develop your portfolio site with the following items:

   * A navbar

   * A responsive layout

   * Responsive images

* The Bootstrap portfolio should minimize the use of media queries.

* Screenshots are provided as a reference in the `Assets/Images` folder. Your app does not need to be _exactly_ like the images. Use Bootstrap to create a similar, responsive layout.

### Site

* GitHub repository with README describing the project

* Used Bootstrap's grid system (containers, rows, and columns).

* On an `xs` screen, content takes up the entire screen. On `sm` and larger screens, there are margins on the left and right sides of the screen.

* Functional, deployed application

* A Navbar and Footer that is consistent on every page

* Navbar also includes links to the other parts of the web application.(Home, Portfolio and Contact)

* Footer also includes links to my own linkedin and Github

* Semantic html used

* Sticky Footer used
